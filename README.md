# Employee Attrition Prediction and Retention Strategy
## Overview
This repository contains a Google Colab Notebook that demonstrates a comprehensive approach to predicting employee attrition and designing a strategic retention plan. The notebook includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, building and tuning machine learning models, and actionable recommendations based on employee segmentation.
## Key Features
### 1. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Summarized key insights from the dataset through visualizations and descriptive statistics.
- Highlighted trends and factors contributing to employee attrition.
### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Encoding: transformed categorical variables into numerical formats for machine learning models
- Feature Scaling: standardized features to ensure equal importance in model training
- Splitting data into test sets and training sets
### 3. Building Machine Learning Models 
- Baseline Algorithms: established initial benchmarks and shortlised ML models for further usage
- Logistic Regression: fit the initial model, fine-tuning, and evaluation
- Random Forest: fit the initial model, fine-tuning, feature importance, and avaluation
### 4. ROC Chart
### 5. Conclusion and Recommendation 
- Employee segmentation into meaningful groups
- Retention plan includes actional strategies to retain high-risk employees

## Key Results 
- Logistic Regression is selected as the best perfoming model due to the higher ROC score, as compared to that of the Random Forest
- Feature importance retrived from Random Forest unfolds key factors for attrition.

## Notebook Structure

3. Building Machine Learning Models
4. Conclusion & Recommendation

## Usage
This notebook is my practice projects to dive deeper into building ML models, which is used for:
- Predicting employee attrition in organizations
- Understanding key drivers of employee turnover
- Come up with actional retention strategies based on segmentation

## Future Work
- Experiment with advanced models like Gradient Boosting or XGBoost for improved performance.
- Conduct additional feature engineering to enhance model predictions.
- Explore cost-sensitive learning to prioritize high-impact employees.
